            The architecture validation found issues with your code. Please check the workflow logs for details.

            ### Common Issues:
            - **File naming**: Files should use kebab-case (e.g., \`login-form.tsx\`)
            - **Hook naming**: Hooks should start with \`use-\` prefix (e.g., \`use-login.ts\`)
            - **Folder naming**: Folders should use kebab-case, private folders should start with \`_\`
            - **Import rules**: Layers cannot import from higher layers (see ARCHITECTURE.md)
            - **Cross-feature imports**: Features cannot import from other features

            Please review [ARCHITECTURE.md](https://github.com/${owner}/${repo}/blob/develop/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the complete guidelines.`
